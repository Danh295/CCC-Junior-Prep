# Welcome to Lesson # 4!
Today we will be talking about how to use objects! Today's lesson will also be very short, as you have to learn the syntax of your program online, either documentation or a tutorial, I'll only cover some basic stuffs here

- ## Python
- ```python 
- class Student:
- ```
- this is an object, you can have many other stuffs inside of this object, for example:
- ``` python
- class Student:
-  name 
-  grade 
-  teacher
- ```
- we can also assign stuff to these variables 
- ``` python
- class Student:
-  def __init__(self, name, grade, teacher):
-    self.name = name
-    self.grade = grade
-    self.teacher = teacher
- ```
-### Example program
- ```python
- class Student
-  def __init__(self, name, grade, teacher):
-    self.name = name
-    self.grade = grade
-    self.teacher = teacher
- s1 = Student('arihan', 7, 'idk')
- print(s1.name)
- print(s1.grade)
- print(s1.teacher)
- ```

- ## Java
- ``` java
- static class Student{}
- ```
- this is an object, you can have many other stuffs inside of this object, for example:
- ``` java
- static class Student{
-  String name, teacher; int grade;
- }
- ```
- we can assign stuff to these variables
- ``` java
- static class Student {
-    String name, teacher; int grade;
-    public Student(String name, int grade, String teacher){
-      this.name = name;
-      this.grade = grade;
-      this.teacher = teacher;
-    }
- }
- ```
-### Example program
- ``` java
- static class Student {
-    String name, teacher; int grade;
-    public Student(String name, int grade, String teacher){
-      this.name = name;
-      this.grade = grade;
-      this.teacher = teacher;
-    }
- }
- public static void main(String[]args){
-   Student s = new Student("arihan", 7, "idk");
-   System.out.println(s.name);
-   System.out.println(s.grade);
-   System.out.println(s.teacher);
- }
- ```
> # C++
- ``` cpp
- struct Student {}
- ```
- this is an object, you can have many other stuffs inside of this object, for example:
- ``` cpp
- struct Student{
-   String name, teacher; int grade;
- }
- ```
- to assign stuff to these variables, you need to assign them in the main, or you can preset them in the struct, the implementation   
- is left to the reader
-### Example Program
- ``` cpp
- struct Student{
-    String name, teacher; int grade;
- }
- int main(){
-    Student s;
-    s.name = "arihan";
-    s.teacher = "idk";
-    s.grade = 7;
-    cout<<s.name<<s.grade<<s.teacher<<endl;
-    return 0;
- }
- ```
- That's pretty much it, you can put methods in there, whatever you want, the rest of it is for you to learn by yourself, or you can   
- look up tutortials online that go deeper into objects and classes    
- I'll explain more along the way, in other lessons
