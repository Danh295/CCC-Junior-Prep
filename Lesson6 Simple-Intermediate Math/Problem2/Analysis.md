# Analysis
- Though we haven't really learned brute force yet, you can understand the problem this way:   
    - Just loop through all possible triples and find the ones where the median is equal to **x**    
- Go check out lesson 8 for more information on brute force

## Time Complexity
 - Going through all possible triples is **O(N<sup>3</sup>)** time, as **N** is only **100**, this will pass in time

## Memory Limmit
- Having an array of **100** integers is sufficient for this problem

## Data Types
- having an integer data type is sufficient for this problem
