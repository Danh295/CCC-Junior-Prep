# Analysis
- After reading this problem, the word **'swap'** should give you a connection to bubblesort immediately,      
- this is just a simple bubble sort implementation, just keep track of how many swaps it takes for each sort

## Time Complexity

- Though **N** is not given, **L** is, and I can tell you that **N** is **not an arbitrary** number, so lets just say **N <= 50**,      
- **L** is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 50, so the time complexity would be **O(L^2 * N)**, or about **O(N^3)**   
- That makes this run in about **O(50^3)** or **O(75 000)**, which will run in time   

## Memory Limit
- An array of 50 integers is below the memory limit

## Data types
- Numbers are less than or equal to 50, no risk of overflow
