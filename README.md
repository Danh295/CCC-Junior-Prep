# CCC-Junior-Prep
- this is for beginner level people who need help to prep for the ccc, go to the introduction folder after reading this README file

# Languages

## Python
- great language, easy implementation and easy to code, but may be slow for advanced problems

## Java
- highly recommend using this language for junior, fast, easy to implement

## C++
- fast language, but lower level than java and python, so a bit harder to code in, but great language for higher level contests
