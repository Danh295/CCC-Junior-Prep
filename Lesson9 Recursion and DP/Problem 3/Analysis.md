# Analysis
- This is a string recursion problem!   

- This might be a bit hard, but its really not, we can look at it this way:

  - We start with the original string, then cut off the 1st character each time we recursion it, in java we can use the method ```.substring()```

- Other languages provide similar methods like c++ 's ```.substr()```, or python's `slicing`: `[1:]`.

- Then we just have to check if the first character equals the second character. 

  - If it is, then return the first character + the ```*``` plus the rest of the recursion string.

  - If not, return the the first character plus the rest of the cursion string.

- We have a ```base case``` where the if the string's ```length``` is smaller than 2, then we just return the string itself.

   ```
   function pairStar(str) {
     if str.length < 2:
       return str
     if str.charAt(0) == str.charAt(1):
       return str.charAt(0) + "*" + pairStar(str.substring(1))
     return str.charAt(0) + pairStar(str.substring(1))
   ```

## Time Complexity
- This runs in **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** time, but it will pass in time.

## Space Complexity
- This has a space complexity of **O(N<sup>2</sup>)**, but it will be fine.
