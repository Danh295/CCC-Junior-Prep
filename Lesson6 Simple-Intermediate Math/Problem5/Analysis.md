# Analysis
- Let **t<sub>1</sub>** be the time it takes for the stone to hit the bottom of the well. The remaining time taken by the sound to climb back up is **t-t<sub>1</sub>*8. 
- Let the depth of the well be **x**.
- You will get **x = [(gt<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup>]/2** and **x = c(t-t<sub>1</sub>)**.
> Solving the equation for **x** will give you the depth of the well
- The velocity as the stone hits the water is **gt<sub>1</sub>**

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity will be **O(1)** time and will pass the time limit.

## Data Types
- A double data type is sufficient.
