# Welcome to Lesson # 3!
- This lesson is going to be very short, as I only have some tips for each language, as everyone has their own way of debugging

## Rubber Ducking Debugging
- The basis of this debugging style is literally read your program and just seeing how your program runs, so just understand what   
- the program is doing, in essence, forcing your program to explain themselves of what they are doing

## Python
- python is a pretty high level language, so syntax is not that big of a problem

### TIPS
- Make sure to read the input correctly   
- Try not to make your code overcomplicated   
- Make sure you know how each built in commands works, as there are alot   
- Make your code easy to read, for yourself and others, it makes debugging alot easier   
- Most syntax errors are usually caught by your IDE, but watch out for index out of bounds or overflow errors   
- Put comments in important places   
- Print out important variables when debugging, don't waste your time with unuseful variables

## Java
- java's a medium level language, but most syntax are caught by the complier

### TIPS
- Make sure to read the input correctly   
- Try not to make your code overcomplicated   
- Make sure you know how each built in commands works, as there are alot   
- Make your code easy to read, for yourself and others, it makes debugging alot easier   
- Most syntax errors are usually caught by your IDE, but watch out for index out of bounds or overflow errors   
- Put comments in important places   
- Print out important variables when debugging, don't waste your time with unuseful variables   
- Memory, java is pretty strict on memory, so watch out on your memory usage

## C++
- c++ a low level language, alot of errors can come from memory and points
### TIPS
- Be sure to set your pointers right, don't assign it to random memory locations   
- Watch out on segmentation faults, usually happens with bad memory allocation or memory leak (unstable variables or actions)   
- Make sure to read the input correctly   
- Try not to make your code overcomplicated   
- Make sure you know how each built in commands works, as there are alot   
- Make your code easy to read, for yourself and others, it makes debugging alot easier   
- Most syntax errors are usually caught by your IDE, but watch out for index out of bounds or overflow errors   
- Put comments in important places   
- Print out important variables when debugging, don't waste your time with unuseful variables   

- I hope these tips are useful, but you will quickly learn your own way of debugging   
- and debugging is an essential skill that you need to learn, the more you code, the better your debugging skills are
