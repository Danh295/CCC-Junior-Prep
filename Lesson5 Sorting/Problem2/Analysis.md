# Analysis
- After reading the problem statement, we can see it just wants us to sort the list, please implement a sorting algorithm other than   
- a built in sort, but that's basically the entire problem statement

## Time Complexity
- since **N** is no larger than **100**, a **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** bubble sort algorithm will suffice

## Memory Limit
- since there is no more than **100** elements, and a integer can be used to store these elements, the memory limit is    
- **100 &times; 4 = 400 bytes**, so we should be good

## Data types
- since the elements are no larger than **32000**, even a short will suffice, any data type can store these numbers without worrying about overflow
