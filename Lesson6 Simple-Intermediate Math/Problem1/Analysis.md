# Analysis
- This question is basically askings for the smallest mode, implement a frequency array to find it

## Time Complexity
- The frequency array runs **O(N)** time, which will pass under the time limit

## Memory Limit
- **O(T)**, where **T** is biggest number in the array, since a frequency array has this property. This will pass under the memory limit

## Data Types
- A integer data type is sufficient for this problem
