# Analysis
- We can see that this is an ```arithmetic sum``` problem, and can be easily solved with the formula, but we are practicing recursion here, so its best to use recursion.      
- The recurrence is very easy, for ```f(n)```, it is equal to itself plus the number before it.    
- so it can be represented as ```f(n) = n + f(n - 1)```, and we can just directly implement this with a ```base case``` of 0 where its just 0.

     ```
     function aritmetic(n):
       if n == 0:
          return 0
       return n + aritmetic(n - 1)
     ```

## Time Complexity
- This is an **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** time complexity problem, but with the low bounds, it will run in time.

## Space Complexity
- This has an **O(N<sup>2</sup>)** space complexity, but with the low bounds, it doesn't matter too much.
