# Welcome To Lesson #2!

## Binary Search
- its a powerful sorting algorithm that can find objects in sub - linear time --> **O (log(n)) time, where n is the size of the array   
- its used alot in competitve programming and as well in softwares and games
- I will be focusing on the implementation and how it works

## How does it work?

### Necessary Prerequisites: the array **must be sorted**

### Algorithm:
- it picks a pivot / mid point, at the middle index of the **current** array, let l and r be the left and right indexes of the array,
- meaning l is the most left index of the array and r is the most right index of the array, the mid point is the average of these 2 indexes
- then it compares that mid point value to the value you want to find, lets call the value you want to find as 'key'   
- then if the key is bigger, so the right half of the previous array, now this is the new array
- if the key is smaller, the array shrinks to the left half of the previous array, now this is the new array
- this continues until you find the element or the left index is bigger than the right index

## Time Complexity
- as you can see, the array we search cuts by half everytime, so the time complexity of this algorithm is 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8... + 1/(n/2), or
- **log(n)** time,   
- which is very fast for a search algorithm, this is indefintely faster than the **O(n)** time naive search algorithm,    
- where we search every single element.    
- but since we do have to sort the array, which most languages uses a version of **mergesort** which has
- a time complexity of **O(n log(n))**,   
- so the time complexity of this algorithm is actually **O(n log(n) + log(n))** which is **O(n log (n))**

## Pseudo code:
- a pseudo implementation of the above algorithm
 ```
 list = []
 key = random variable
 sort(list)
 left = 0, right = list.length - 1
 while left <= right:
   mid = (left + right) / 2
   if list[mid] equals key 
      break;
   else if list[mid] > key
      right = mid - 1
   else if list[mid] < key
      left = mid + 1;
 ```

## Practice!
- I have some problems and an implementation of binary search for you, go complete them!   
- ### Good Luck!
