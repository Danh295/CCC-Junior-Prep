# Welcome to Lesson # 5!

- Here I'm going to talk about [bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) and sorting with objects

## Bubble Sort
-Bubble sort is a not really efficient sorting algorithm, but it can be applied to many problems with low bounds, it was used in a CCO question [CCC 1996 Problem 1](https://wcipeg.com/problem/ccc96s2p1), so I highly suggest you learn it.

## How does it work?
- Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. It has to go through the entire array each time, and it does it for N times, so the time complexity is **O(N * N)** or **O(N ^ 2)**. Geeks for Geeks provides a better explanation, I suggest you read it. [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/). Lets implement the above algorithm:
## Pseudo Code Implementation
```
array = []
isSorted = false
while isSorted is false:
  isSorted = true
  for i in range length of array 1
    if array[i] > array[i + 1]
    temp = array[i]
    array[i] = array[i + 1]
    array[i + 1] = temp
    isSorted = false
```


## Sorting With Objects
- When we sort an object, we need its own comparator, as the language doesn't know how to sort your objects you just implement a comparator in your object class or when you call sort
## Examples
## Python
- Link to source: [Sorting in python](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html)
``` python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, grade, age):
        self.name = name
        self.grade = grade
        self.age = age
    def __lt__(self, other):
       return self.age < other.age
```
or
``` python
sorted(student_objects, key=lambda student: student.age)   # sort by age
```
## Java
```java
static class Test implements Comparator<Test>{
   int from, to;
   public Test(int from, int to){
       this.from = from;
       this.to = to;
   }
   public int compareTo(Test t){
       if(to == t.to){
         return from t.from;
       }
       return to t.to;
   }
}
```
or
```java
Arrays.sort(array, new Comparator<T>() {
  @Override
	public int compare(T t1, T t2) {
		return t1.a t2.a;
	}
});
```
## C++
``` cpp
struct T{
  int a;
}
bool cmp(T t1, T t2){
  return t1 < t2;
}
int main(){
  T array[100];
  sort(t, t + 100, cmp);
}
```
