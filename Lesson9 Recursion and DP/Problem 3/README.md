# Problem 1
- Go to this [link](https://codingbat.com/prob/p158175) to start the problem, remember, you must sign up/registed on to [codingbat](http://codingbat.com/java) first. Type the code in the box to check your answer.   

## Important

### When Submitting To CodingBat
- For ```python``` and ```c++``` users, there isn't a submission box, so just check my solutions to see if yours is correct.      
- For ```java``` users, be sure to name the method the same as the one in the problem, also state it as ```public```, and don't put it as ```static```. My suggestion would to be writing the code in the ```box provided```, as there isn't too much code that is needed to be written.

- ### Good Luck!
