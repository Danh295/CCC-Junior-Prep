# Analysis
- After you read the problem, this question is asking you to do a bubble sort, print the array once and then print out the array after each swap    

## Time Complexity
- **N &le; 20**, so this will definetly pass in time

## Memory Limit
- A array of 20 integers is well under the memory limit

## Data Types
- A integer data type will suffice
